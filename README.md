# Centrality-Analysis-in-Social-Networks
This project explores centrality analysis in a social network-like structure using graph theory. o identify the most influential nodes, multiple centrality measures are computed:

Degree Centrality → Importance based on direct connections
Closeness Centrality → Proximity to other nodes
Betweenness Centrality → Influence in shortest paths
Eigenvector Centrality → Influence of a node based on its neighbors’ importance
Advanced Ranking with Weighted Entropy & PageRank
To refine centrality rankings, we incorporate:

Weighted Entropy to combine multiple centrality measures into a single score
Fine-tuning using PageRank & Weighted Entropy to enhance the final ranking
This approach provides a robust, unbiased ranking of influential nodes in a social network.
